**RACING CAR**

This project leverages reinforcement learning within OpenAI's Gymnasium library to train a racing car. The primary goal is to optimize the car's performance through continuous learning and adaptation to dynamically generated track conditions.

**OVERVIEW**

The racing car environment used in this project is based on the CarRacing-v2 environment provided by OpenAI's Gymnasium. This environment is designed to challenge the reinforcement learning agent with a track that is randomly generated for each episode, ensuring a unique and varied experience every time.

**ENVIRONMENT DETAILS**

The CarRacing-v2 environment presents the agent with a top-down view of a car on a fixed track. The agent's objective is to navigate the track as quickly and efficiently as possible. The environment provides:

  •State Space: The state is represented as an RGB image of the car and track.

  •Action Space: The agent can control the car's steering, acceleration, and braking.

  •Rewards: The agent receives a reward based on the progress made along the track, encouraging efficient navigation.

**IMPLEMENTATION**

The implementation of this project involves training a reinforcement learning model using algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The model is trained to interpret the visual input (state) and output appropriate actions to navigate the car along the track.

**KEY FEATURES**

Dynamic Track Generation: Each episode features a uniquely generated track, providing a wide variety of scenarios for the agent to learn from.

Continuous Learning: The agent continuously improves its performance through iterative learning, adapting to different track conditions.

Advanced Algorithms: Utilizes state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms to achieve optimal performance.
