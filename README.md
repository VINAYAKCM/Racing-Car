# Racing-Car
This project employs reinforcement learning within OpenAI's Gym library to train a racing car. The car navigates a dynamically generated fixed track, offering a unique challenge with each episode. The primary goal is to optimize the car's performance through continuous learning and adaptation to varying track conditions.
